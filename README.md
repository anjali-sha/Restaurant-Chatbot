# Restaurant-Chatbot
Restaurant Chatbot using Rasa and Zomato Apis
The chatbot provide results for tier-1 and tier-2 cities only, while for tier-3 cities, it replies back with "We do not operate in that area yet".
# Cuisine Preference: 
The bot takes the cuisine preference from the customer. The bot lists out the following six cuisine categories (Chinese, Mexican, Italian, American, South Indian & North Indian) and the customer can select any one out of that.
# Average budget for two people: 
Segment the price range (average budget for two people) into three price categories: lesser than 300, 300 to 700 and more than 700. The bot asks the user to select one of the three price categories.
The bot displays the top 5 restaurants in a sorted order (descending) of the average Zomato user rating (on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the highest). 
The bot also asks the user whether he/she wants the details of the top 10 restaurants on email. If the user replies 'yes', the bot asks for userâ€™s email id and then send it over email. Else, it replies with a 'goodbye' message.
